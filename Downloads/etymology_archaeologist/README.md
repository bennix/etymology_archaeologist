# Etymology Archaeologist Skill

## 🔍 What is This?

**Etymology Archaeologist (词源考古学家)** is a comprehensive Claude skill that transforms English vocabulary learning into an archaeological journey. Instead of simply memorizing definitions, you'll excavate the deep history of each word, understanding how ancient civilizations thought and communicated.

## ✨ Key Features

- **6-Step Deep Analysis**: Every word gets a complete etymological excavation
- **Root-First Approach**: Trace words back to Proto-Indo-European, Latin, and Greek origins
- **Cultural Context**: Understand the historical and philosophical environment of word creation
- **Visual Learning**: Reconstruct the "mental picture" ancient people had when creating words
- **Cognate Networks**: Discover surprising connections between seemingly unrelated words
- **Batch Processing**: Analyze entire documents or word lists automatically

## 🎯 The 6-Step Process

### 1️⃣ The Word Today (现代词义)
Current definition, pronunciation (IPA), and usage

### 2️⃣ Morpheme Breakdown (词素拆解)
Deconstruct into prefix, root, and suffix components

### 3️⃣ Etymological Roots (词源引述)
Academic citations from OED, Etymonline, and other authorities

### 4️⃣ Reconstructing the Original Concept (本义重现)
Vivid storytelling of the word's birth and original meaning

### 5️⃣ The Word's Journey (演变脉络)
Timeline from ancient roots to modern usage

### 6️⃣ Cognate & Concept Link (同源智慧链接)
Related word families and philosophical reflections

## 💡 Example Usage

### Analyze a Single Word
```
User: "Analyze the word 'respect'"

Claude will provide:
- IPA: /rɪˈspekt/
- Breakdown: re- (back) + -spect- (to look)
- Etymology: From Latin respectus "to look back at"
- Original Concept: The Roman act of stopping and looking back
- Journey: PIE *spek- → Latin → French → English
- Cognates: spectacle, inspect, prospect, suspect
- Reflection: What kind of "looking" is respect?
```

### Batch Process Multiple Words
```
